# FrozenPizza
Simple social media site built in NodeJS using frameworks Express, MongoDB, Bootstrap and JQuery

This was one of my first projects to learn web development. I used Express as the backend, MongoDB as the database and Bootstrap and JQuery for my frontend libraries/frameworks.
It's still hosted at http://frozenpizza.herokuapp.com if you want to check it out. 
This was the first project that I managed to connect all the different parts of a web application, and it felt super freaking awesome. Even though the project doesn't look like much, the code to connect the frontend, backend and database is the shining star.
